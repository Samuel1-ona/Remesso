/// "Please pay me." The one endpoint an agent that wants to RECEIVE needs.
///
/// Everything else here is about paying: an agent pays for a rate, pays to
/// pull a transfer forward, pays another agent. An agent that wants to be paid
/// had no move at all — its operator had to read a 42-character address to a
/// human who typed it into a phone, which is the worst possible way to move
/// the one value where a single wrong character loses the money.
///
/// So: POST an address and the terms you would like, get back a link. The
/// request appears in the payer's app, and the link opens the create form with
/// the fields already filled.
///
/// What this CANNOT do, which is the entire design:
///   - it cannot create a schedule
///   - it cannot approve an allowance or move a token
///   - it cannot tell the payer anything the payer must believe
///
/// It writes a row that prefills a form. The sender reads it, edits whatever
/// they like, and signs in their own wallet — and from that moment the
/// contract is the authority, as it is for every other payment.
///
/// Free, and unauthenticated. A fee here would be a toll on asking to be paid,
/// which is the wrong place to put one: the money is on the paying side.
/// `verify_jwt = false` for the same reason as the other agent endpoints —
/// callers have no Supabase JWT and should need no account.
