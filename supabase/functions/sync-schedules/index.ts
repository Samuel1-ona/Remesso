/// The chain stays the authority. This writes a mirror so the executor can
/// find the work; every value it acts on is still read from the contract at
/// run time, and a row here can no more move money than any other row.
///
/// Not from the subgraph, deliberately. `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOLDSKY_SUBGRAPH_URL` is
/// a UI accelerant and an invariant says the money path must not read it — a
/// dead subgraph should mean a slower history, never a missed payment. This

/// Scanning by id rather than by log range: `nextScheduleId` gives the upper
/// bound, the database gives what is already known, and the difference is a
/// handful of `getSchedule` calls with no checkpoint to keep, no block range
/// to page and no reorg to unwind. That is the right trade at a few hundred
/// schedules. Past that, index `ScheduleCreated` instead.
