/// types it into a phone is the worst possible transfer of the one value where
/// a single wrong character sends money to nobody. A link carries it exactly.
///
/// What a link can and cannot do, because this is the whole safety argument:
/// it fills in a form. It cannot create a schedule, cannot approve an
/// allowance, and cannot sign anything — the sender still reviews every field
/// and signs in their own wallet. So the worst a hostile link achieves is a
/// prefilled recipient the sender is shown and must accept, which is why
/// `NewSchedulePage` announces that a link filled the form rather than letting
/// the values appear as if the sender chose them.
///
/// Everything is validated here rather than trusted: an address that is not an
/// address, a token that is not on the Direct allowlist, or a cadence the
/// picker does not offer is dropped, not passed through. A link is input from
/// a stranger.
