/// The agent card: what you get by handing somebody one URL.

/// Until now pointing an agent at Remesso meant naming a Supabase project id,
/// which nobody types and nobody trusts. This is the conventional place to
/// look — an agent handed the app's origin and nothing else can find every
/// endpoint, the contract, and the registry entry from here.
///
/// **It points; it does not copy.** No prices, no currencies, no EIP-712
/// domains. The ERC-8004 entry went stale precisely because it restated facts
/// that then changed, and a second copy on a second host is a second thing to
/// forget. Anything that can move lives behind `capabilities` and is read from
/// the deployment that owns it.
///
/// Open CORS on purpose: a browser-side agent that cannot read this cannot
/// discover anything, and there is nothing here that is not already public.
