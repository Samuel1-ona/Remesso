/// Commit to paying someone on a schedule, as an agent, from your own wallet.
///
/// The counterpart to `pay-remesso.ts`. That one pays per call: you ask, you
/// are quoted, you sign, it is over. This one signs a MANDATE — a standing
/// authorisation to move a fixed amount to a fixed address on a fixed rhythm,
/// which the executor then carries out without asking you again.
///
/// That is a different kind of promise, so read what it can and cannot do:
///
///   - the recipient, the amount and the cadence are fixed HERE, at signing.
///     Nothing can change them afterwards — not Remesso, not the contract
///     owner, not you. Cancelling is the only edit.
///   - it can never move more than `AMOUNT` per interval, never more than
///     `RUNS` times, and never past the expiry.
///   - it spends through an ERC-20 allowance you grant below. That allowance
///     is the real ceiling: revoke it and every future run fails.
///   - `TRIGGER=remesso` additionally lets Remesso's executor bring a payment
///     forward — same recipient, same amount, consuming a scheduled payment
///     rather than adding one. Leave it unset and only the clock moves money.
///
/// Unlike paying, this needs CELO for gas: two transactions, an approval and
/// the schedule itself. Roughly 0.06 CELO at the time of writing.
